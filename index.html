Welcome to my student portfolio! My name is Tejaswini Paritala and I am currently a senior at Pace University. Throughout my education, I have always been passionate about learning new things and developed an interest in coding. This portfolio is a collection of my academic and extracurricular achievements, as well as examples of my skills and abilities. Inside, you will find a selection of my best work from,y early bachelor's days to my current master's, as well as projects and essays that showcase my interests and abilities. I have also included some reflections on my progress and areas for improvement.<br>
This portfolio is an important tool for me as I prepare for job opportunities. It will also serve as a valuable resource for self-reflection and personal development. I hope you find this portfolio informative and enjoyable. Thank you for taking the time to review my work.
